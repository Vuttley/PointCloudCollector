# PointCloudCollector

Project from CERISE UFG

This project involves developing a mapping device designed to automate the scanning process and mesh creation. The system uses various sensors, including a 2D lidar, two global shutter cameras, an IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit), a Raspberry Pi 5, and two servos to collect and process data.

Sensors in Use:

STL27L (2D Lidar)
WITMotion WT901 (IMU)
Raspberry Pi Global Shutter Camera (for high-quality image capture)
VD66GY and VD56G3 (additional sensors or cameras)
